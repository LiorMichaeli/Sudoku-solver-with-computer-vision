# Sudoku-solver-with-computer-vision

In this project, I built a program that gets an image that contains somewhere sudoku board,
and the sequence of numbers already on the board (from left to right and from top to bottom),
and outputs a graphical sudoku board with a solution. 

## For example:

<p align="center">
  <img src="Data/sudoku_img_5.jpg" width="200" height = "250" />
  <img src="Results/result_5.png" width="200" height = "250" /> 
</p>
